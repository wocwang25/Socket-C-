# Chatting operation for multi-client handled by Socket C++
- To run this program, ensure that you have a Linux/Unix base OS or simply a VM run on that OS
- Second, your base can run Makefile (this is optional, you can run each side manually)
- Step for run server:
    - cd Socket
    - make run
    - ./server
- After run the server, you need to open new Shell to run as many as client you want
- Then base on the "fd" information that the server show, you will know "fd" of each client (save on server)
- Use that "fd" information to connect to other client 
- Chating~~
